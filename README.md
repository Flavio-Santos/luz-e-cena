# Luz e Cena

Luz e Cena is a study project developed with React and TypeScript as part of an Alura
course. The main goal was to create a simple cinema visualization app that fetches a list
of movies from a mock server (`json-server`) and displays them on the frontend.

## 📚 Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Practice building reusable React components with TypeScript and CSS
  Modules.
- **Backend:** Uses `json-server` to simulate a REST API for movie data.
- **Frontend:** Fetches movies from the server, displays them in a list, and allows
  searching by movie name.

## ✨ Main Features

- Fetches and displays a list of movies from a mock API.
- Search functionality to filter movies by name.
- Reusable components built with React, TypeScript, and CSS Modules.
- Clean and modular code structure.
